Google QUIC analyzer/detector for Bro
=====================================

This analyzer can parse and detect the Google implementation of QUIC
(called GQUIC here for simplicity), using the wire format described at:

https://www.chromium.org/quic.

The version of GQUIC used by Chrome at the time of writing this analyzer
was Q039 with some Google servers (and possibly Chrome canary builds)
also being able to use Q043.  This analyzer was able to detect both
those versions during testing.

The wire format described in GQUIC documents at that time (May 4-5 2018)
also appeared out of sync with the actual implementations used in the
wild.

Additionally, there seems to be regular effort to migrate GQUIC to track
the IETF draft standard for QUIC described at:

https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts
https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/quic/documents/

With that draft differing in significant ways from the GQUIC
implementations this analyzer was tested against and also having changed
its wire format recently.

To summarize, this GQUIC analyzer, if not updated in the future, isn't
expected to continue working with later evolutions of the QUIC protocol.

Installation
------------

Via `bro-pkg <http://bro-package-manager.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_::

    bro-pkg install corelight/bro-gquic

Else you will have to build and install it yourself::

    ./configure --bro-dist=<path>
    make
    make install

Usage
-----

By default this simply detects whether a UDP connection looks like the
QUIC protocol, adds the "guic" string to conn.log's "service" field and
then stops parsing.

If you want to write a custom script that handles other events provided
by the analyzer, you might want to have the analyzer continue to parse
the connection even after the protocol has been confirmed::

    redef GQUIC::skip_after_confirm = F;

The events provided can give coarse information regarding packet type
(Regular Packet vs. Version Negotiation vs Public Reset) as well as the
content of the Public Header (like Packet Number, QUIC Version,
Connection ID, or Diversification Nonce).
